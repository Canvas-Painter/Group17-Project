## Issue Tracking

This included plans outside of the software development itself.

## Coding Guidlines
[Javascript (Google)](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html)
- Google’s JavaScript coding guidelines reflect similar practices that our team are exercised previously. Google is also a very reputable source to reflect their style.

[HTML/CSS (Mozilla)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Writing_style_guide/Code_style_guide/CSS)
- Mozilla is a great place to go to for web development questions, so it felt like a good idea to use their guidelines that are easy to follow.

[Python (Python)](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
- Why not use the guidelines of the source? We only use Python for our testing, but it’s still good to ensure we follow a respectable guideline such as Python themselves.
