# Release

## Source Code
This repository holds all the information related to the development of this project. There are a few branches outside of *main* that were used to develop specific features. You may look through the history to become more informed on how features were made and changed throughout. You can additionally check git blame.

Essentially the totality of the source code is in the [PainterExtension](../PainterExtension) directory. Which is split into different features and also contains some other folders such as [Test](../PainterExtension/Test). Each feature functions independently and the file linking everything together is the [manifest](../PainterExtension/manifest.json). To learn more read please read the [contribution guide](Contribution.md).

## Issue Tracking
We have a Trello board [Project Trello](https://trello.com/b/JSf9TgUc/cs-362-pt-team-17-project-painter) where we tracked the our plans for the project. This included plans outside of the software development itself. The "Backlog" includes some of our plans for future development of this project; more ideas are listed in the projects Living Document [Project Living Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Sg_moN46KJ2fcR-Hak0WlZDEZvt-L2gO4nh3mJlo9x4).

## Coding Guidlines
[Javascript (Google)](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html)
- Google’s JavaScript coding guidelines reflect similar practices that our team are exercised previously. Google is also a very reputable source to reflect their style.

[HTML/CSS (Mozilla)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Writing_style_guide/Code_style_guide/CSS)
- Mozilla is a great place to go to for web development questions, so it felt like a good idea to use their guidelines that are easy to follow.

[Python (Python)](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
- Why not use the guidelines of the source? We only use Python for our testing, but it’s still good to ensure we follow a respectable guideline such as Python themselves.
