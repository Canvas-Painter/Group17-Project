  2. As we're about to reach Beta testing, our group is putting the finishing touches on extension.

They should certainly be comeplete this week and in time for Beta testing. We will also be taking care to ensure our living document is up-to-date and quality for final submission so that we can put our best foot foward for the poster presentation and conclusion of the course.

1.Last week my goal was to start working and to hopefully have completed gamify calendar at least running or functional in a local instance and start tying things in for a beta test.
2. This goal did not go as well as I expected for the simply reason that I was having trouble getting the PDF parser to work. I have since delegated gamify calendar to Cameron who is more than enthustastic to collaborate with me on it.
3. The goals for this next week are to get the side emun function fully working and integrated as well as integrate gamify calendar to the main branch. I am hopeful this will get done.

1. I plan to start working on testing and figure out testing (4 days) and start reasearch into using Canvas API for tracking users with unique IDs, possibly for database.
2. I have started work on testing, but ran into a number of issues, testing should be done soon, but it's been repeatedly failing whenever I try to run it. I have tried to get it work all week with no sucess. I also checked with the team and found that there may be a problem with MacOS and will be trying to do it on a different computer. Finally, I checked to find thta Cameron is already working on the Canvas API functionality.
3. I plan to make sure my features are ready for beta including instructions and all assignment parts are complete (7 days) and help prepare poster (1 day).

  **Cameron Dilworth**
