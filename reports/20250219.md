**Team Report**
  1. *week 5*: Complete User and Development Documentation (4 hours - team), Continue testing each others software and verify at least 1 (3 days - team), Complete Standardized Syllabus (3 day)
  2. We've continued to make good progress with the project. We've also gotten CI setup in GitHub which is very useful for ensure our progress is not useless and is benefiting the progression of the software. Most features we've planned to implement are in the "wrap-up" stage (not all) where we only have a few things to add/tweak, as well as clarify any code that could use it. 
  3. Write out Documentation for the extension within the popup (2 days), Add custom themes (3 days), Complete grading features (3 days)

**Contributions and Plans**:

  **Jacob Porter**
1. Complete CSS for all of my Canvas pages (3 days), Begin implementing Custom Themes (3 days), Test with other user accounts (1 day)
2. I'm on the cusp of finishing "dark mode" where I only need to make sure it works for the "calendar" page. Once that is complete, it should be pretty quick to add custom themes as it only requires that I update some CSS vars based on variable users create in Chrome localStorage so it can be saved and reloaded/modified for repeated use (barring any unforseen complication(s)). 
3. Complete Dark Mode (1 day), Implement Custom Themes (3 days)
