**Team Report**
  1. *week 1, empty*
  2. We've continued to work on the Project Proposal and overall Project idea; refining and developing the MVP we wish to create. We've also began creating the first Project Presentation which is including these newer and more refined ideas. No software development has started yet, but research and planning has so we can *hit the ground running* next week. We have also have created and signed a team contract outlining team rules and responsibilites for the term.

Goals for next week: Complete Project Proposal (2 hours), Complete Project Presentation (45 min), Split up project responsibilites (Done), Find a new meeting time that satifies all memeber time constraints (15 min), Complete *(at least)* 1 feature that passes a user test (5 days), and book consistant TA meeting time for the term.
