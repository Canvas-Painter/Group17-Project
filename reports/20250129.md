  1. Centralized all additions required for submittion of Project Proposal Document in said document for next team meeting. Began creating the Project Presentation slides. Updated Trello with current project "To do" requirements. Updated GitHub with version of Project Proposal Document and "reports" subdirectory with this report (20250116.md).
  2. Updating CSS via and extension is a bit tricky because I've had to look through multiple pages of Cavas HTML to find out which tags/ids/classes I need to overwrite. I've gone through multiple iterations of injecting the CSS to find "the best way", but it's been veery time consuming with little return. I've gotton some css to be adjusted, but have much more to do.
  3. Try and complete CSS injection the Home, Modules, and Syllabus pages so they look good (3 days)

1. My goal last week was to finish our Project plan, Proposal, and Presentation went smoothly. During presentation, I felt I could have done a bit better. I wrote a script and immediately started reading the wrong part, I was then able to flip back around and complete the presentation without making a complete fool out of myself. Last week I also began pushing frameworks of files I am going to be working on to the github as well as reorganizing files so we have a neat work flow.
2. The presentation I felt could have gone better but I won't complain. I didn't hear any criticism from the TA during this weeks meeting so I don't think it was too terrible. The framework for much of the gamify calendar, sideMenu, and the wbesite went well. I am now realizing I am going to have to build an PDF scraper to get the correct syllabus information if the professor doesnt input the details straight to canvas.
3. This weeks goals are to begin the first sprint, I am going to switch focus and build the PDF scrapper as soon as I can, and get that out of the way so that Oscar can contuine with his section of implementing the standardized syllabus.
