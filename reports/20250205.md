**Team Report**
  1. *week 3*: Complete Project Architecture and Design (2 hours - team), Complete *(at least)* 1 feature that passes a user test (3 days - team)
  2. Development and research has gone well so far for both Subgroups. We have found that the "Speeding up Canvas" goal might not be possible with how we originally planned. We've decided to place that feature on the *back burner* for now and started focusing on other, more plausible features. We've also found that publishing our extension officially would take lots of effort that aren't nessesary for simply producing the software so our goals to do that have also been sidelined for the forseeable future (mainly the duration of this course). 
  3. Goals for next week: Complete next Team Presentation (2 hours - team), Begin testing eachothers software and verify at least 1 (3 days - team)

**Contributions**:

  **Jacob Porter**
  1. Try and complete CSS injection the Home, Modules, and Syllabus pages so they look good (3 days)
  2. I've made good progress so far and would say I'm nearly done with the baseline "darkmode" feature. Main holdup has been overall workload with other classes so my time to focus on this class has been a little thin. I have no worries about getting this part done and believe I should also be able to implement a "custom themes" feature by the end of the term.  
  3. Edit JS manual adjustments to CSS (see git history), complete Assignments and Grades CSS adjustments similarly to previously completed pages (1 day)

1. Will work on the theme section of the app next week allowing users to change light or dark mode for the application. Will also work on a Help & Info button designed to provide users with a brief description of each button and setting available in the Project Painter Chrome extension. When clicked, the button should direct users to an HTML page containing concise explanations of the extension's features.
