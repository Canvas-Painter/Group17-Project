**Team Report**
  1. *week 3*: Complete Project Architecture and Design (2 hours - team), Complete *(at least)* 1 feature that passes a user test (3 days - team)
  2. Development and research has gone well so far for both Subgroups. We have found that the "Speeding up Canvas" goal might not be possible with how we originally planned. We've decided to place that feature on the *back burner* for now and started focusing on other, more plausible features. We've also found that publishing our extension officially would take lots of effort that aren't nessesary for simply producing the software so our goals to do that have also been sidelined for the forseeable future (mainly the duration of this course). 
  3. Goals for next week: Complete next Team Presentation (2 hours - team), Begin testing eachothers software and verify at least 1 (3 days - team)

**Contributions**:

  **Jacob Porter**
  1. Try and complete CSS injection the Home, Modules, and Syllabus pages so they look good (3 days)
  2. I've made good progress so far and would say I'm nearly done with the baseline "darkmode" feature. Main holdup has been overall workload with other classes so my time to focus on this class has been a little thin. I have no worries about getting this part done and believe I should also be able to implement a "custom themes" feature by the end of the term.  
  3. Edit JS manual adjustments to CSS (see git history), complete Assignments and Grades CSS adjustments similarly to previously completed pages (1 day)

1. This weeks goals are to begin the first sprint, I am going to switch focus and build the PDF scrapper as soon as I can, and get that out of the way so that Oscar can contuine with his section of implementing the standardized syllabus.
2. . I was sick with covid with week so progress was slow but I worked on completing the PDF parser and integrating it with the rest of the code.
3. . Did research into canvas extension framework dev tools like vite to assist in devolpement.

1. Prepared for presentation (changed last minute to not be part of presentation) and commented on others presentations to give feedback to their projects.
2. Worked on Standard Syllabus User Interface and User Experience to include a pop-up or pop-out window with editable fields and use local saving.
3. Assisted in code organization to keep all features in seperate folders and merge features for functionality for continued development.

1. Next week: Contribute more to the team, and go above and beyond to make up for previous weeks. Complete research for Canvas API, and present to the team my findings about how we can connect and use Canvas information within our extension.
2. Looked over Canvas API documentation and began getting familiar. Created new Canvas account and got API key for it. Found no way to get an API key from the OSU Canvas accounts, but for now, making a new "temporary: account seems to work. API calls will give information in the form of a .json file, so JavaScript will be the best method to communicate with Canvas. Did not formulate a presentable document to the team.
3. Finish making the document to share findings; Write a successful few functions that can make calls using the Canvas API, and turn it into usable information. Experiment using JS, Python, and HTML. Continue to find a way to get an API key on Canvas for our school accounts (Consider security risks when asking the school for permission).

  **Andrew Vu**
1. Will work on the theme section of the app next week allowing users to change light or dark mode for the application. Will also work on a Help & Info button designed to provide users with a brief description of each button and setting available in the Project Painter Chrome extension. When clicked, the button should direct users to an HTML page containing concise explanations of the extension's features.
