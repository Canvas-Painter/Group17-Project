**Team Report**
  1. *week 4*:
  2. We were able to complete and present our midterm for the project successfully. We've also made good progress on the extension as the PDF parser has been completed and will now need to be integrated with the Standardized Syllabus. Theres also progres sbeing made with the grade features and Darkmode is nearly complete; custom themes would be a quick addition soon after.
  3. Complete User and Development Documentation (4 hours - team), Continue testing each others software and verify at least 1 (3 days - team), Complete Standardized Syllabus (3 day)

**Contributions**:

  **Jacob Porter**
1. Edit JS manual adjustments to CSS (see git history), complete Assignments and Grades CSS adjustments similarly to previously completed pages (1 day)
2. I've completed converting the JS manual adjustment to all be in the CSS. Canvas had very odd naming that doesn't make sense so it's been time consuming to figure out what needs to have its own CSS vs a general rule that can apply to many. I've also come across some elements that are dymanically named (ids and/or classes) so applying CSS to them is a bit more tricky to override Canvases original CSS. I've completed many pages; still have a couple to finish off and then need to test with other Canvas accounts for more variability.
3. Complete CSS for all of my Canvas pages (3 days), Begin implementing Custom Themes (3 days), Test with other user accounts (1 day)
