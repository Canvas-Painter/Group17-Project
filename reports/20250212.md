Theres also progres sbeing made with the grade features and Darkmode is nearly complete; custom themes would be a quick addition soon after.

**Contributions**:

  **Jacob Porter**
1. Edit JS manual adjustments to CSS (see git history), complete Assignments and Grades CSS adjustments similarly to previously completed pages (1 day)
2. I've completed converting the JS manual adjustment to all be in the CSS. Canvas had very odd naming that doesn't make sense so it's been time consuming to figure out what needs to have its own CSS vs a general rule that can apply to many. I've also come across some elements that are dymanically named (ids and/or classes) so applying CSS to them is a bit more tricky to override Canvases original CSS. I've completed many pages; still have a couple to finish off and then need to test with other Canvas accounts for more variability.
3. Complete CSS for all of my Canvas pages (3 days), Begin implementing Custom Themes (3 days), Test with other user accounts (1 day)
