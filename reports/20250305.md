2. I went through the entire living document and updated it according to the notes made on our midterm submission. I also made a couple edits to the poster after Andrew made it. Everything went smooth and was completed successfully. I also made the demo video for our project; however, I need to redo it as I didn't show all the features in our extension as they we're all completed yet.
3. Redo the demo video (2 hours)

1. Finish the gamified calendar completely. Find a way to get a students assignment information without using the Canvas API. Test for any and all bugs. Help with the poster and documentation!
2. Finished the Gamify Calendar feature entirely, fixed most bugs, and noted any potential bugs. Made a scraper within the Gamify Calendar that took Canvas's confusing calendar HTML structure, and turned it into usable information by the webapp.
3. I will spend until Sunday fixing any more potential bugs and cleaning up the gamify calendar feature before our presentation. Will also help with any last minute things on teh project with the rest of the group.
