          "text": "Assignments 10% CReative Exploration Assignments These assignments will ask you to engage in non-traditional sorts of reflection aimed at connecting the material to ‘real life’\r\nand our lived experiences. These short homework assignments are assessed for good-faith completion and are due before the start of class. You will be required to present your Creative Exercise in some form in class. Further details will be provided with each assignment, and will be announced a few days before they are due. Since these are meant to facilitate in class work or discussion, they cannot be made up or turned in late.\r\n15% In Class Work Throughout the semester, I will assign group or individual work to be completed during the class period. This work will vary in nature, but could be: writing reflections, mini group analysis\r\nprojects, reading quizzes, etc. I will collect this work at the completion of class and score it depending on the nature of the assignment (ie. quizzes will be scored for accuracy, writing reflections will be assessed for good-faith completion, etc.)\r\nThis work depends on attending class and cannot be made-up outside accommodations you and I agree to at the beginning of class. The two lowest scores of the semester will be dropped.\r\n32.5% Midterm You will have a midterm exam. It will be in-person during our class time slot. The mid-term cannot be rescheduled or\r\nTechnology & Ethics 丨Winter 25 丨 Patterson 4\n\nmade-up if you miss it.\r\n42.5% Final Exam You will have a final exam during the exam period. The exam\r\nwill be in-person. The final will be cover material covered\r\nthroughout the entire course. The final cannot be rescheduled\r\nor made-up if you miss it.\r\nGrading Scale + What Your Grades Mean Your grades are an evaluation of three things: the skills and knowledge built over the course and your effort. You will not be granted any graded merely for effort alone. You must be able to\r\ndemonstrate your skills and knowledge to the corresponding levels. A (93-100), A- (90-92): Exceptional. Outstanding grasp of subject and exceptional analysis and synthesis of course material. Demonstrates strong ability: to evaluate and construct philosophical arguments and concepts, to apply material to the real world, or be creative. B+ (86-89), B (83-85), B- (80-82): Proficient. Good grasp of subject matter and satisfactory analysis and synthesis of course material. Demonstrates satisfactory ability: to evaluate and construct philosophical arguments and concepts, to apply material to the real world, or be creative. C+ (76-79), C (73-75), C- (70-72): Developing.\r\nExhibits some understanding of subject matter. Analysis and synthesis course material needs improvement. Ability to evaluate and construct philosophical arguments and concepts is limited; has difficulty connecting material to real life contexts, lacks creativity.\r\nD+ (66-69), D (63-65), D- (60-62) Below Expectations.\r\nEvidence of minimally acceptable familiarity with subject matter. Ability to analyze and synthesize course materials is inadequate. Ability to evaluate and construct philosophical arguments is poor; material is not well connected to real world issues, minimal demonstration of creativity.\r\nF (>60). Inadequate. Unsatisfactory understanding of the subject matter. Unable to analyze and synthesize course\r\nmaterial; or to evaluate and construct philosophical arguments and concepts; material is not connected to real world issues, no demonstration of creativity. Technology & Ethics 丨Winter 25 丨 Patterson 5\n\nCOURSE Policies Technology & Ethics 丨Winter 25 丨 Patterson 6\r\nLate Assignments Late assignments on weekly work (Creative Exploration Assignments & In class work) will not be accepted without a pre - established agreement or accommodation. I cannot grant make-up exams outside of agreed upon accommodations. Plan your travel accordingly.\r\nAttendance & Tardiness Attendance is not a distinct part of your grade in the sense that I will not assign you points simply for attending or not attending in itself. However, your ability to do-well on graded work will be impacted by your attendance, particularly, the in-class work. I will keep track of attendance and participation and use it to determine course grades in borderline cases. Other benefits may also be reserved for those who attend\r\nfrequently including, for instance, priority when seeking extra help with any coursework. I prefer that you attend and participate since I am eager to learn from you, too, and I know many of your classmates feel the same. If something arises during the semester that greatly impacts your ability to attend class, please contact me. If you experience the loss during the semester, please see OSU’s\r\nBereavement Policy.\r\nParticipation Meaningful participation in class makes the course more interesting for everyone, and is crucial for your success in the course. Meaningful participation looks like: ● attending class,\r\n● attending office hours,\r\n● asking questions in discussion,\r\n● asking for clarification on a concept or point,\r\n● building off someone else’s point in discussion,\r\n● active listening in lecture and group work,\r\n● collaborating in group work, and more.\r\nIf something arises during the semester that greatly impacts your ability to\r\nattend class, please contact me\r\nLaptops & HandHeld Devices It is disruptive to be online shopping, answering email, texting and so forth during class. It is massively distracting to your peers who may be trying to concentrate. Additionally, it is inconsiderate to me, the instructor and your peers to be watching a soccer match during class. Recent research\r\nsuggests that when people use their laptops during class, instead of\n\nTechnology & Ethics 丨Winter 25 丨 Patterson 7\r\nmulti-tasking, their attention is shifted quickly among tasks, resulting in repeated disruption in attentional focus. Learning and productive\r\ndiscussions in this class require sustained focus. In addition, research also suggests that those who take notes by hand have better comprehension and understanding of the material than those who type their notes.I ask that you exclusively use your laptops for classwork and only bring them\r\nto class if you can use them to be on-task 100 percent of the time.\r\nNote: if you require special accommodations that involve using a device, please let me know. I am happy to provide such accommodations, but these will be handled using specific policies on a case-by-case basis.\r\nPlagiarism, Academic Integrity & AI policy Cheating and plagiarism will still not be tolerated in this course. Please reacquaint yourself with Oregon State’s policies.I am obligated to pass on any suspected violations of the honor code to the university\r\nadministration, whose responsibility it is to determine whether a violation has occurred. Note that if you are found to be in violation of the\r\nuniversity’s academic honor code, you will fail the course. In this course, our task is to think critically about the ethics of technology. In this process, your ideas and your voice are what matters. Part of the task of this course is to come to answers about when and where we should be using AI, and off loading that thinking to Chat GPT or other\r\nlarge language models interferes with our ability to come to independent conclusions about them. Using AI text generation tools at any stage of working on your assignments (idea generation, looking for sources,\r\noutlining/organizing, writing, revising, etc.) would make it much harder for me to evaluate and respond helpfully to your work, since I wouldn’t be able to tell what’s coming from you. Moreover, research on automation shows us that once something becomes automated, it leads to deskilling.\r\nWriting is an essential part of developing your critical thinking skills and for this course. Moreover, moral agency and reasoning and deskilling in those domains is deeply troubling. As such, you’re not permitted to use AI text generating tools such\r\nas Chat GPT at any point when working on your assignments, and I will\r\ntreat the use of AI text generators as academic dishonesty, and will report the incident to the Honor Council. Furthermore, I ask that you respect my intellectual labor and not feed class materials, such as lecture slides, to AI chatbots. If you have any questions or confusion about this policy, please contact me.\n\nTechnology & Ethics 丨Winter 25 丨 Patterson 8\r\nContacting me Please contact me with questions and concerns about the course -\r\nhowever, I ask that you first reference the syllabus to see if your question\r\ncan be answered here. Please direct all messages to me via email. I do not answer messages via Canvas inbox. Do not contact me through Canvas - I will not respond.\r\nI will respond to emails within 24-48 hours. I am not available via email\r\non evenings and weekends, but I am always available during office\r\nhours to answer questions about course materials. If I have missed an email, feel free to send a follow-up if it has been more than 3 business days. Substantive discussions about content will not be answered over email (instead, schedule a time to meet).\r\nReferring to me Please address me as either Professor Patterson or Dr. Patterson. I use she / her / hers pronouns .\r\nOffice hours Office hours are a resource to clarify topics from lectures or readings. You\r\ncan also come to office hours to discuss anything else related to the\r\ncourse topic.\r\nAccommodations If, at any point in the semester, a disability or personal circumstances affect your learning in this course, please feel free to reach out to me. I am\r\ncommitted to helping you succeed in this class. For formal accommodations, if you have a documented condition (physical or psychological), please contact Disability Access Services so that we can work together to develop the appropriate accommodations. Please note, I cannot offer accommodations retrospectively, ie. after an\r\nassignment is due or turned in - particularly if something is several weeks late already. Please meet with me or contact me at the beginning of semester and/or before a due date.\r\nGrade Complaints If you have a complaint about your grade, set up an appointment to meet with me. I will not entertain grade complaints over email."
